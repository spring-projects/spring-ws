    <title>Why Contract First?</title>
    <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            When creating Web services, there are two development styles: <emphasis>Contract Last</emphasis> and 
            <emphasis>Contract First</emphasis>. When using a contract-last approach, you start with the Java code, and 
            let the Web service contract (<acronym>WSDL</acronym>, see sidebar) be generated from that.
            When using contract-first, you start with the WSDL contract, and use Java to implement said contract.
        </para>

            <title>What is WSDL?</title>
            <para>
                WSDL stands for Web Services Description Language. A WSDL file is an XML document that describes a Web 
                service. It specifies the location of the service and the operations (or methods) the service exposes.
                For more information about WSDL, refer to the 
                <link xl:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">WSDL specification</link>.
            </para>
        </sidebar>
        <para> 
            Spring-WS only supports the contract-first development style, and this section explains why.

        <title>Object/XML Impedance Mismatch</title>
        <para>
            Similar to the field of ORM, where we have an 
            <link xl:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_impedance_mismatch">Object/Relational impedance mismatch</link>,
            there is a similar problem when converting Java objects to XML.
            At first glance, the O/X mapping problem appears simple: create an XML element for each Java object, 
            converting all Java properties and fields to sub-elements or attributes. However, things are not as  
            simple as they appear: there is a fundamental difference between hierarchical languages such as XML 
            (and especially XSD) and the graph model of Java<footnote>
            <para>Most of the contents in this section was inspired by <xref linkend="alpine"/> and 
            <xref linkend="effective-enterprise-java"/>.</para></footnote>.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>XSD extensions</title>
            <para>
                In Java, the only way to change the behavior of a class is to subclass it, adding the new behavior to 
                that subclass. In XSD, you can extend a data type by restricting it: that is, constraining the valid values
                for the elements and attributes.
                For instance, consider the following example:<programlisting><![CDATA[
<simpleType name="AirportCode">
  <restriction base="string">
      <pattern value="[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]"/>
  </restriction>
</simpleType>]]></programlisting>
                This type restricts a XSD string by ways of a regular expression, allowing only three upper case 
                letters. If this type is converted to Java, we will end up with an ordinary 
                <classname>java.lang.String</classname>; the regular expression is lost in the conversion process, 
                because Java does not allow for these sorts of extensions.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Unportable types</title>
            <para>
                One of the most important goals of a Web service is to be interoperable: to support multiple platforms
                such as Java, .NET, Python, etc. Because all of these languages have different class libraries, you
                must use some common, interlingual format to communicate between them. That format is XML, which is
                supported by all of these languages.
            </para>
            <para>
                Because of this conversion, you must make sure that you use portable types in your service 
                implementation. Consider, for example, a service that returns a 
                <classname>java.util.TreeMap</classname>, like so:<programlisting><![CDATA[
public Map getFlights() {
  // use a tree map, to make sure it's sorted
  TreeMap map = new TreeMap();
  map.put("KL1117", "Stockholm");
  ...
  return map;
}]]></programlisting>
                Undoubtedly, the contents of this map can be converted into some sort of 
                XML, but since there is no <emphasis>standard</emphasis> way to describe a map in XML, it will be 
                proprietary. Also, even if it can be converted to XML, many platforms do not have a data structure 
                similar to the <classname>TreeMap</classname>. So when a .NET client accesses your Web service, it
                will probably end up with a <classname>System.Collections.Hashtable</classname>, which has different 
                semantics.
            </para>
            <para>
                This problem is also present when working on the client side. Consider the following XSD snippet, which
                describes a service contract:<programlisting><![CDATA[
<element name="GetFlightsRequest">
  <complexType>
    <all>
      <element name="departureDate" type="date"/>
      <element name="from" type="string"/>
      <element name="to" type="string"/>
    </all>
  </complexType>
</element>]]></programlisting>
                This contract defines a request that takes an <type>date</type>, which is a XSD datatype representing
                a year, month, and day. If we call this service from Java, we will probably use 
                either a <classname>java.util.Date</classname> or <classname>java.util.Calendar</classname>. However,
                both of these classes actually describe times, rather than dates. So, we will actually end up sending data that
                represents the fourth of April 2007 at midnight (<literal>2007-04-04T00:00:00</literal>), which is not
                the same as <literal>2007-04-04</literal>.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Cyclic graphs</title>
            <para>
                Imagine we have the following simple class structure:<programlisting><![CDATA[
public class Flight {
  private String number;
  private List<Passenger> passengers;
    
  // getters and setters omitted
}

public class Passenger {
  private String name;
  private Flight flight;
    
  // getters and setters omitted
}]]></programlisting>
                This is a cyclic graph: the <classname>Flight</classname> refers to the <classname>Passenger</classname>,
                which refers to the <classname>Flight</classname> again. Cyclic graphs like these are quite common in 
                Java. If we took a naive approach to converting this to XML, we will end up with something 
                like:<programlisting><![CDATA[
<flight number="KL1117">
  <passengers>
    <passenger>
      <name>Arjen Poutsma</name>
      <flight number="KL1117">
        <passengers>
          <passenger>
            <name>Arjen Poutsma</name>
            <flight number="KL1117">
              <passengers>
                <passenger>
                   <name>Arjen Poutsma</name>
                   ...]]></programlisting>
                which will take a pretty long time to finish, because there is no stop condition for this loop.
            </para>
            <para>
                One way to solve this problem is to use references to objects that were already marshalled, like 
                so:<programlisting><![CDATA[
<flight number="KL1117">
  <passengers>
    <passenger>
      <name>Arjen Poutsma</name>
      <flight href="KL1117" />
    </passenger>
    ...
  </passengers>
</flight>]]></programlisting>
                This solves the recursiveness problem, but introduces new ones. For one, you cannot use an XML validator
                to validate this structure. Another issue is that the standard way to use these references in SOAP 
                (RPC/encoded) has been deprecated in favor of document/literal (see WS-I
                <link xl:href="http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html#SOAP_encodingStyle_Attribute">Basic
                Profile</link>).
            </para>
        </section>
        <para>
            These are just a few of the problems when dealing with O/X mapping. It is important to respect these issues
            when writing Web services. The best way to respect them is to focus on the XML completely, while using Java
            as an implementation language. This is what contract-first is all about.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Contract-first versus Contract-last</title>
        <para>
            Besides the Object/XML Mapping issues mentioned in the previous section, there are other reasons for 
            preferring a contract-first development style.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>Fragility</title>
            <para>
                As mentioned earlier, the contract-last development style results in your web service contract 
                (WSDL and your XSD) being generated from your Java contract (usually an interface). If you are using 
                this approach, you will have no guarantee that the contract stays constant over time. Each time you 
                change your Java contract and redeploy it, there might be subsequent changes to the web service
                contract.
            </para>
            <para>
                Aditionally, not all SOAP stacks generate the same web service contract from a Java contract. This 
                means changing your current SOAP stack for a different one (for whatever reason), might also change
                your web service contract.
            </para>
            <para>
                When a web service contract changes, users of the contract will have to be instructed to obtain 
                the new contract and potentially change their code to accommodate for any changes in the contract.
            </para>
            <para>
                In order for a contract to be useful, it must remain constant for as long as possible. If a contract 
                changes, you will have to contact all of the users of your service, and instruct them to get the new 
                version of the contract.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Performance</title>
            <para>
                When Java is automatically transformed into XML, there is no way to be sure as to what is sent across 
                the wire. An object might reference another object, which refers to another, etc. In the end, half of 
                the objects on the heap in your virtual machine might be converted into XML,
                which will result in slow response times. 
            </para>
            <para>
                When using contract-first, you explicitly describe what XML is sent where, thus making sure that it is 
                exactly what you want.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Reusability</title>
            <para>
                Defining your schema in a separate file allows you to reuse that file in different scenarios. If you 
                define an <type>AirportCode</type> in a file called <filename>airline.xsd</filename>, like so:                
            </para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
<simpleType name="AirportCode">
    <restriction base="string">
        <pattern value="[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]"/>
    </restriction>
</simpleType>]]></programlisting>
            <para>
                You can reuse this definition in other schemas, or even WSDL files, using an
                <literal>import</literal> statement.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Versioning</title>
            <para>
                Even though a contract must remain constant for as long as possible, they <emphasis>do</emphasis> need 
                to be changed sometimes. In Java, this typically results in a new Java interface, such as 
                <interfacename>AirlineService2</interfacename>, and a (new) implementation of that interface. Of 
                course, the old service must be kept around, because there might be clients who have not migrated 
                yet.
            </para>
            <para>
                If using contract-first, we can have a looser coupling between contract and implementation. Such a 
                looser coupling allows us to implement both versions of the contract in one class. We could, for 
                instance, use an XSLT stylesheet to convert any "old-style" messages to the "new-style" messages.
