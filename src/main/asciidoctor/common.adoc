[[common]]
= Shared components

In this chapter, we will explore the components which are shared between client- and server-side Spring-WS development. These interfaces and classes represent the building blocks of Spring-WS, so it is important to understand what they do, even if you do not use them directly.

[[web-service-messages]]
== Web service messages

[[web-service-message]]
=== `WebServiceMessage`

One of the core interfaces of Spring Web Services is the `WebServiceMessage`. This interface represents a protocol-agnostic XML message. The interface contains methods that provide access to the payload of the message, in the form of a `javax.xml.transform.Source` or a `javax.xml.transform.Result`. `Source` and `Result` are tagging interfaces that represent an abstraction over XML input and output. Concrete implementations wrap various XML representations, as indicated in the following table. 

[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
| Source/Result implementation
| Wraps XML representation

| `javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource`
| `org.w3c.dom.Node`

| `javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMResult`
| `org.w3c.dom.Node`

| `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource`
| `org.xml.sax.InputSource` and `org.xml.sax.XMLReader`

| `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXResult`
| `org.xml.sax.ContentHandler`

| `javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource`
| `java.io.File`, `java.io.InputStream`, or `java.io.Reader`

| `javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult`
| `java.io.File`, `java.io.OutputStream`, or `java.io.Writer`
|===

In addition to reading from and writing to the payload, a Web service message can write itself to an output stream.

[[soap-message]]
=== `SoapMessage`

The `SoapMessage` is a subclass of `WebServiceMessage`. It contains SOAP-specific methods, such as getting SOAP Headers, SOAP Faults, etc. Generally, your code should not be dependent on `SoapMessage`, because the content of the SOAP Body (the payload of the message) can be obtained via `getPayloadSource()` and `getPayloadResult()` in the `WebServiceMessage`. Only when it is necessary to perform SOAP-specific actions, such as adding a header, getting an attachment, etc., should you need to cast `WebServiceMessage` to `SoapMessage`.

[[message-factories]]
=== Message Factories

Concrete message implementations are created by a `WebServiceMessageFactory`. This factory can create an empty message, or read a message based on an input stream. There are two concrete implementations of `WebServiceMessageFactory`; one is based on SAAJ, the SOAP with Attachments API for Java, the other based on Axis 2's AXIOM, the AXis Object Model.

==== `SaajSoapMessageFactory`

The `SaajSoapMessageFactory` uses the SOAP with Attachments API for Java to create `SoapMessage` implementations. *SAAJ* is part of *J2EE* 1.4, so it should be supported under most modern application servers. Here is an overview of the *SAAJ* versions supplied by common application servers: 

[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
| Application Server
| *SAAJ* Version

| BEA WebLogic 8
| 1.1

| BEA WebLogic 9
| 1.1/1.2^1^

| IBM WebSphere 6
| 1.2

| SUN Glassfish 1
| 1.3

2+|^1^Weblogic 9 has a known bug in the *SAAJ* 1.2 implementation: it implement all the 1.2 interfaces, but throws a `UnsupportedOperationException` when called. Spring Web Services has a workaround: it uses *SAAJ* 1.1 when operating on WebLogic 9.
|===

Additionally, Java SE 6 includes *SAAJ* 1.3. You wire up a `SaajSoapMessageFactory` like so:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="messageFactory" class="org.springframework.ws.soap.saaj.SaajSoapMessageFactory" />
----

NOTE: *SAAJ* is based on DOM, the Document Object Model. This means that all SOAP messages are stored *in memory*. For larger SOAP messages, this may not be very performant. In that case, the `AxiomSoapMessageFactory` might be more applicable.

==== `AxiomSoapMessageFactory`

The `AxiomSoapMessageFactory` uses the AXis 2 Object Model to create `SoapMessage` implementations. *AXIOM* is based on *StAX*, the Streaming API for XML. StAX provides a pull-based mechanism for reading XML messages, which can be more efficient for larger messages.

To increase reading performance on the `AxiomSoapMessageFactory`, you can set the `payloadCaching` property to false (default is true). This will read the contents of the SOAP body directly from the socket stream. When this setting is enabled, the payload can only be read once. This means that you have to make sure that any pre-processing (logging etc.) of the message does not consume it.

You use the `AxiomSoapMessageFactory` as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="messageFactory" class="org.springframework.ws.soap.axiom.AxiomSoapMessageFactory">
    <property name="payloadCaching" value="true"/>
</bean>
----

In addition to payload caching, *AXIOM* also supports full streaming messages, as defined in the `StreamingWebServiceMessage`. This means that the payload can be directly set on the response message, rather than being written to a DOM tree or buffer.

Full streaming for *AXIOM* is used when a handler method returns a *JAXB2*-supported object. It will automatically set this marshalled object into the response message, and write it out to the outgoing socket stream when the response is going out.

For more information about full streaming, refer to the class-level Javadoc for `StreamingWebServiceMessage` and `StreamingPayload`.

[[soap_11_or_12]]
==== *SOAP* 1.1 or 1.2

Both the `SaajSoapMessageFactory` and the `AxiomSoapMessageFactory` have a `soapVersion` property, where you can inject a `SoapVersion` constant. By default, the version is 1.1, but you can set it to 1.2 like so:

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:util="http://www.springframework.org/schema/util"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/util
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/util/spring-util-2.0.xsd">

    <bean id="messageFactory" class="org.springframework.ws.soap.saaj.SaajSoapMessageFactory">
        <property name="soapVersion">
            <util:constant static-field="org.springframework.ws.soap.SoapVersion.SOAP_12"/>
        </property>
    </bean>

</beans>
----

In the example above, we define a `SaajSoapMessageFactory` that only accepts *SOAP* 1.2 messages.

[WARNING]
====
Even though both versions of *SOAP* are quite similar in format, the 1.2 version is not backwards compatible with 1.1 because it uses a different XML namespace. Other major differences between *SOAP* 1.1 and 1.2 include the different structure of a Fault, and the fact that `SOAPAction` HTTP headers are effectively deprecated, thought they still work.

One important thing to note with *SOAP* version numbers, or WS-* specification version numbers in general, is that the latest version of a specification is generally not the most popular version. For *SOAP*, this means that currently, the best version to use is 1.1. Version 1.2 might become more popular in the future, but currently 1.1 is the safest bet.
====

[[message-context]]
=== `MessageContext`

Typically, messages come in pairs: a request and a response. A request is created on the client-side, which is sent over some transport to the server-side, where a response is generated. This response gets sent back to the client, where it is read.

In Spring Web Services, such a conversation is contained in a `MessageContext`, which has properties to get request and response messages. On the client-side, the message context is created by the <<client-web-service-template,`WebServiceTemplate`>>. On the server-side, the message context is read from the transport-specific input stream. For example, in HTTP, it is read from the `HttpServletRequest` and the response is written back to the `HttpServletResponse`.

[[transport-context]]
== `TransportContext`

One of the key properties of the SOAP protocol is that it tries to be transport-agnostic. This is why, for instance, Spring-WS does not support mapping messages to endpoints by HTTP request URL, but rather by mesage content.

However, sometimes it is necessary to get access to the underlying transport, either on the client or server side. For this, Spring Web Services has the `TransportContext`. The transport context allows access to the underlying `WebServiceConnection`, which typically is a `HttpServletConnection` on the server side; or a `HttpUrlConnection` or `CommonsHttpConnection` on the client side. For example, you can obtain the IP address of the current request in a server-side endpoint or interceptor like so:

[source,java]
----
TransportContext context = TransportContextHolder.getTransportContext();
HttpServletConnection connection = (HttpServletConnection )context.getConnection();
HttpServletRequest request = connection.getHttpServletRequest();
String ipAddress = request.getRemoteAddr();
----

[[xpath]]
== Handling XML With XPath

One of the best ways to handle XML is to use XPath. Quoting <<effective-xml>>, item 35:

[quote, Elliotte Rusty Harold]
XPath is a fourth generation declarative language that allows you to specify which nodes you want to process without specifying exactly how the processor is supposed to navigate to those nodes. XPath's data model is very well designed to support exactly what almost all developers want from XML. For instance, it merges all adjacent text including that in CDATA sections, allows values to be calculated that skip over comments and processing instructions` and include text from child and descendant elements, and requires all external entity references to be resolved. In practice, XPath expressions tend to be much more robust against unexpected but perhaps insignificant changes in the input document.

Spring Web Services has two ways to use XPath within your application: the faster `XPathExpression` or the more flexible `XPathTemplate`.

[[xpath-expression]]
=== `XPathExpression`

The `XPathExpression` is an abstraction over a compiled XPath expression, such as the Java 5 `javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression`, or the Jaxen `XPath` class. To construct an expression in an application context, there is the `XPathExpressionFactoryBean`. Here is an example which uses this factory bean:

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
          http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd">

    <bean id="nameExpression" class="org.springframework.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionFactoryBean">
        <property name="expression" value="/Contacts/Contact/Name"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="myEndpoint" class="sample.MyXPathClass">
        <constructor-arg ref="nameExpression"/>
    </bean>

</beans>
----

The expression above does not use namespaces, but we could set those using the `namespaces` property of the factory bean. The expression can be used in the code as follows:

[source,java]
----
package sample;

public class MyXPathClass {

    private final XPathExpression nameExpression;

    public MyXPathClass(XPathExpression nameExpression) {
        this.nameExpression = nameExpression;
    }

    public void doXPath(Document document) {
        String name = nameExpression.evaluateAsString(document.getDocumentElement());
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    }

}
----

For a more flexible approach, you can use a `NodeMapper`, which is similar to the `RowMapper` in Spring's JDBC support. The following example shows how we can use it:

[source,java]
----
package sample;

public class MyXPathClass  {

   private final XPathExpression contactExpression;

   public MyXPathClass(XPathExpression contactExpression) {
      this.contactExpression = contactExpression;
   }

   public void doXPath(Document document) {
      List contacts = contactExpression.evaluate(document,
        new NodeMapper() {
           public Object mapNode(Node node, int nodeNum) throws DOMException {
              Element contactElement = (Element) node;
              Element nameElement = (Element) contactElement.getElementsByTagName("Name").item(0);
              Element phoneElement = (Element) contactElement.getElementsByTagName("Phone").item(0);
              return new Contact(nameElement.getTextContent(), phoneElement.getTextContent());
           }
        });
      PlainText Section qName:lineannotation level:5, chunks:[// do something with list of Contact objects] attrs:[:]
   }
}
----

Similar to mapping rows in Spring JDBC's `RowMapper`, each result node is mapped using an anonymous inner class. In this case, we create a `Contact` object, which we use later on.

[[xpath-template]]
=== `XPathTemplate`

The `XPathExpression` only allows you to evaluate a single, pre-compiled expression. A more flexible, though slower, alternative is the `XpathTemplate`. This class follows the common template pattern used throughout Spring (JdbcTemplate, JmsTemplate, etc.). Here is an example:

[source,java,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
package sample;

public class MyXPathClass {

    private XPathOperations template = new Jaxp13XPathTemplate();

    public void doXPath(Source source) {
        String name = template.evaluateAsString("/Contacts/Contact/Name", request);
        _// do something with name_
    }

}
----

[[logging]]
== Message Logging and Tracing

When developing or debugging a Web service, it can be quite useful to look at the content of a (SOAP) message when it arrives, or just before it is sent. Spring Web Services offer this functionality, via the standard Commons Logging interface.

WARNING: Make sure to use Commons Logging version 1.1 or higher. Earlier versions have class loading issues, and do not integrate with the Log4J TRACE level.

To log all server-side messages, simply set the `org.springframework.ws.server.MessageTracing` logger to level DEBUG or TRACE. On the debug level, only the payload root element is logged; on the TRACE level, the entire message content. If you only want to log sent messages, use the `org.springframework.ws.server.MessageTracing.sent` logger; or `org.springframework.ws.server.MessageTracing.received` to log received messages.

On the client-side, similar loggers exist: `org.springframework.ws.client.MessageTracing.sent` and `org.springframework.ws.client.MessageTracing.received`.

Here is an example `log4j.properties` configuration, logging the full content of sent messages on the client side, and only the payload root element for client-side received messages. On the server-side, the payload root is logged for both sent and received messages:

[source]
----
log4j.rootCategory=INFO, stdout
log4j.logger.org.springframework.ws.client.MessageTracing.sent=TRACE
log4j.logger.org.springframework.ws.client.MessageTracing.received=DEBUG

log4j.logger.org.springframework.ws.server.MessageTracing=DEBUG

log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%p [%c{3}] %m%n
----

With this configuration, a typical output will be:

----
TRACE [client.MessageTracing.sent] Sent request [<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="...
DEBUG [server.MessageTracing.received] Received request [SaajSoapMessage {http://example.com}request] ...
DEBUG [server.MessageTracing.sent] Sent response [SaajSoapMessage {http://example.com}response] ...
DEBUG [client.MessageTracing.received] Received response [SaajSoapMessage {http://example.com}response] ...
----
