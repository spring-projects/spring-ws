<p>
The Flow Builder subsystem, for building and assembling flow definitions.
</p>
<p>
You construct a Flow using a {@link org.springframework.webflow.builder.FlowBuilder}.
This package defines the following flow builder implementations:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.builder.AbstractFlowBuilder} - A
convenience superclass to use when you want to assemble the web flow
in Java code.
</li>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.builder.XmlFlowBuilder} - A flow
builder that reads an XML file containing a web flow definition and
constructs the flow accordingly.
</li>
</ul>
During flow construction, a flow builder may need to access externally
managed <i>flow artifacts</i> referenced by the flow definition.
The @{link org.springframework.webflow.builder.FlowArtifactFactory} fulfills 
this need, acting as a facade or gateway to an external registry of
flow artifacts (such as a Spring Bean Factory).
</p>
<p>
To direct flow construction, use the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.builder.FlowAssembler}.
This package is based on the classic GoF Builder design pattern.
</p>
<p>
This package depends on the webflow, webflow.support, and webflow.action packages.
