<p>
High-level executors for driving the execution of flow definitions.
</p>
<p>
The central concept defined by this package is the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.executor.FlowExecutor}, representing
a facade or entry-point for driving the execution of flows.  This interface acts 
as the system boundary into Spring Web Flow most calling systems interact with.
<p>
The following classes and interfaces are of particular interest to the user of
the web flow system:
<ul>
<li>
{@link org.springframework.webflow.executor.FlowExecutor} - A facade 
clients (e.g. controllers) can use as an entry-point into Spring Web Flow for launching 
and executing flows.
</li>
<p>
This package depends on the webflow, webflow.context, and webflow.execution packages.
