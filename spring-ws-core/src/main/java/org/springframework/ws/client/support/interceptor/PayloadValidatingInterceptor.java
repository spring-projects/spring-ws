/**
 * Client-side interceptor that validates the contents of {@code WebServiceMessage}s using a schema. Allows for both W3C
 * XML and RELAX NG schemas.
 * <p>
 * When the payload is invalid, this interceptor stops processing of the interceptor chain.
 * <p>
 * The schema to validate against is set with the {@code schema} property or {@code schemas} property. By default, only
 * the request message is validated, but this behaviour can be changed using the {@code validateRequest} and
 * {@code validateResponse} properties. Responses that contains faults are not validated.
