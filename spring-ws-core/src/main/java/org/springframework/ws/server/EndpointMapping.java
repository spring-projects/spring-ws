/**
 * Defines a mapping between message requests and endpoint objects.
 * <p>
 * This class can be implemented by application developers, although this is not always necessary, as
 * {@code PayloadRootQNameEndpointMapping} and {@code SoapActionEndpointMapping} are included.
 * <p>
 * HandlerMapping implementations can support mapped interceptors but do not have to. An endpoint will always be wrapped
 * in a {@code EndpointExecutionChain} instance, optionally accompanied by some {@code EndpointInterceptor} instances.
 * The {@code MessageDispacher} will first call each {@code EndpointInterceptor}'s {@code handlerRequest} method in the
 * given order, finally invoking the endpoint itself if all {@code handlerRequest} methods have returned {@code true}.
