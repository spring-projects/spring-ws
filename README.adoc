Spring Web Services is a product of the Spring community focused on creating
document-driven Web services. Spring Web Services aims to facilitate
contract-first SOAP service development, allowing for the creation of flexible
web services using one of the many ways to manipulate XML payloads.

== Installation

Releases of Spring Web Services are available for download from Maven Central,
as well as our own repository, https://repo.spring.io/release[https://repo.spring.io/release].

Please visit https://projects.spring.io/spring-ws to get the right Maven/Gradle settings for your selected version.

== Building Spring Web Services

. Run `./mvnw clean package`

This will generate the artifacts.

You can also import the project into your IDE.

== Releasing Spring Web Services

Snapshots are published automatically via CI server by doing this:

----
$ USERNAME=<username> PASSWORD=<encrypted password> ./mvnw -Pdistribute,snapshot,docs clean -Dmaven.test.skip=true deploy
----

IMPORTANT: Snapshots do NOT include GPG signatures. To do so would require putting a private key on the CI server. The process for releases (below) is manual and DOES include GPG signatures.

To do a release (.RELEASE, .RC?, .M?):

. Check in all changes and ensure there are no edited files.
. Bump up the version in ALL `pom.xml` files to the desired version (e.g. `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=3.0.0.RC1`) and commit the change.
. `git tag <version>` (like v3.0.0.RC1)
. Execute a maven test (`./mvnw -Pdistribute,snapshot,docs clean test`).
. Execute a maven deploy.
* For a milestone: `USERNAME=<user> PASSWORD=<encrypted password> ./mvnw -Pdistribute,milestone,docs clean -Dmaven.test.skip=true deploy`
* For a release: `USERNAME=<user> PASSWORD=<encrypted password> ./mvnw -Pdistribute,release,docs clean -Dmaven.test.skip=true deploy`
* For a release to maven central: `USERNAME=<user> PASSWORD=<nexus password> ./mvnw -Pdistribute,gpg,central clean -Dmaven.test.skip=true deploy -s settings.xml`
. Bump up the version in ALL `pom.xml` files again to the next BUILD-SNAPSHOT.
. Commit the change.
. `git push` (This will push the tagged version along with the release AND the new snapshot commit)
. Inspect handiwork at https://repo.spring.io/ or https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories

NOTE: A word about reference documentation. Based upon https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/gradle-build-and-release-faq#user-content-wiki-docs_schema_dist_publication[this], the `distribute` profile contains an artifactory property that is applied to the ZIP file generated by the `docs` profile. A CRON job will scoop up the zipped up docs and unpack them inside the target location.
