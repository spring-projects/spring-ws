 * servers. Since POP3 does not have a native mechanism to determine which messages are "new", this implementation
 * simply retrieves all messages in the {@link Folder}, and delete them afterwards. All messages in the POP3 mailbox are
 * therefore, by definition, new.
 * <p>
 * Setting the {@link #setDeleteMessages(boolean) deleteMessages} property is therefore ignored: messages are always
 * deleted.
